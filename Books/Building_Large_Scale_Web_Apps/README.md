# Building Large Scale Web Apps
By Addy Osmani & Hassan Djirdeh

## Introduction
Large-scale web apps are **non-trivial** applications requiring **significant** developer effort to maintain.

When building large web applications, **choosing the right abstractions is crucial**. Abstractions like libraries, frameworks.

When building large web applciations, choosing the right abstractions is crucial. The frameworks, libraries and other helper layers should be selected wisely. Factors like core languages, implementation, infrastrcuture, tools and people needs to be considered.

Strong defaults should be set. Like best practices in team and code. It helps developers save time and guide them to make better decisions.

All things needs to be considered for large web applications:

1. Usable:
  - Performance: fast loading, rendering, interactions and animations
  - Task completion: minimal steps required to complete desired tasks
  - Stability: consistent functionality and availability of pages
2. Accessible:
  - Accessibility: users with special needs can access the page. Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast
3. Credibile:
  - Privacy: Safe handling of user data with appropriate level of permission
  - Security: integrity of data and communication on the site
4. Identity management
  - Authenticity: the content on the app is credible
5. Findable:
  - Discoverability: how good can search engines see the pages
6. Desirable:
  - Visual experience: pages are visually appealing
7. Valuable:
  - Functionality: content, functions, and use cases that provide value to the user
